*Inspired by [ng2-mock-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-mock-server)*

An angular 5+ mock to mock back-end. The package uses http client interceptors mechanism. It's a really useful package when real back-end isn't available.

## Features
- No back-end required
- Support regexp and strings in routes definitions
- Support lazy modules
- Works with Angular 5 and 6
- Can be disabled from outside

## Getting started
`npm i ngx-mock-server`
